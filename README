baton |bəˈtän|

  noun, A short stick or staff or something resembling one.

Client programs and API for use with iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented
Data System).

baton is intended as a supplement to the command line client programs
(ils, imeta etc.) provided with a standard iRODS installation. Its
focus is metadata operations for iRODS collections and data objects.

The features it provides are:

- A single JSON format for listing results, composing queries and
  performing updates.

- Listing of data objects and collections as JSON, including their
  metadata (AVUs), file size, access control lists (ACLs) and creation
  and modification timestamps.

- Queries on metadata, on access control lists (ACLs), creation and
  modification timestamps and timestamp ranges. The full range of
  iRODS query operators is supported.

- Optional unbuffered IO for IPC via pipes, with fine-grained error
  reporting for batch operations.

- Simplified API over the iRODS general query API to ease construction
  of new custom queries.

For further details see the man pages or manual, which is available
online at http://wtsi-npg.github.io/baton/

iRODS compatibility:

- Compatible with iRODS 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.1

- Not compatible with iRODS 4.0.1 and 4.0.2


Installation:

Install iRODS and baton dependencies (Jansson) as described in their
documentation. iRODS does not install its headers and libraries in the
standard locations, therefore you should set the location of the root
of the installation using the --with-irods option to the configure
script.

# Use IRODS_HOME to set CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS for compilation (assuming bash)

# Generate the configure script
autoreconf -i

# Generate the makefiles (see INSTALL for arguments to configure)
./configure --with-irods=/path/to/irods

# Compile
make

# Optionally, run the test suite
make check

# If you have run configure with the optional --enable-coverage flag
# you can generate test coverage statistics with lcov.
make check-coverage

# Install, including HTML manual and manpage.
make clean install
